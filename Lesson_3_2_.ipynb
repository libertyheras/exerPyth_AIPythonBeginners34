In a bowl, mix 1 tablespoon of sugar, 1 tablespoon of grated ginger, 4 minced garlic cloves, 1/4 cup of gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes), and 3 tablespoons of fish sauce (or soy sauce). Add 3 chopped green onions, 1 julienned carrot, and 1 julienned daikon radish to the cabbage, then combine with the spice paste. Pack the mixture tightly into a jar, pressing down to remove air bubbles, and leave some space at the top. Let it sit at room temperature for 1-5 days, pressing down daily to keep the vegetables submerged. Once fermented to your liking, store the kimchi in the refrigerator. Enjoy!\n",
